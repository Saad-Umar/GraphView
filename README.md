# GraphView
Subclassed and customized UIView to represent a graphView, just like the iOS 'Stocks' App. 





Note: The repo is a work in progress, examples on how to use the GraphView and proper generalization of the code is yet to be done, however it is not 'impossible' to use it at the moment either, so feel free to embed it anywhere you want to use it. thanks for checking out.
